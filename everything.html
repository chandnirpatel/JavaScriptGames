  <!-- Comments in HTML look like this. -->

  <!--
      All HTML files have this basic structure.
      The data-structure that browsers render into a web-page is
      called the DOM, or Document Object Model.
  -->

  <!--
      You describe the initial DOM with HTML and CSS.
      After the initial load of HTML and CSS, then it is up to
      your Javascript to make changes to the DOM to interact with
      the user.

      We are going to start using an old-school approach, which
      will not scale to larger apps.  Once it starts getting messy
      we will solve it using more advanced techniques and tools.

  <h3>Problem one:</h3>
  <p>Is Chandni awesome?: <span id="output"></span></p>

  <h3>Problem two:</h3>
  <p>
    Colors of the rainbow, in order:
    <span id="color1"></span>
    <span id="color2"></span>
    <span id="color3"></span>
    <span id="color4"></span>
    <span id="color5"></span>
    <span id="color6"></span>
    <span id="color7"></span>
	</p>

  <h3>Problem 4:</h3>
  <p>Random compliment: <span id="compliment"></span></p>

  <h3>Problem 5:</h3>
  <p>
    Now for something more challenging.  Let's generate novel compliments.
    How might you do that?
