  <!-- Comments in HTML look like this. -->

  <!--
      All HTML files have this basic structure.
      The data-structure that browsers render into a web-page is
      called the DOM, or Document Object Model.
  -->

  <!--
      You describe the initial DOM with HTML and CSS.
      After the initial load of HTML and CSS, then it is up to
      your Javascript to make changes to the DOM to interact with
      the user.

      We are going to start using an old-school approach, which
      will not scale to larger apps.  Once it starts getting messy
      we will solve it using more advanced techniques and tools.

  <h3>Problem one:</h3>
  <p>Is Chandni awesome?: <span id="ouput"></span></p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // Comments in Javascript look like this

  // For now our javascript code will go here

  var thisIsAFunction = function(parameter) {
    // In javascript, functions are the most important things.
  };

  var thisIsAnObjectLiteral = {
    thisIsAProperty: 'some string',
    anotherProperty: true
  };

  var chandniIsAwesome = function() {
    return thisIsAnObjectLiteral.anotherProperty;
  };

  // This code is executed as soon as it is loaded by the browser

  if (chandniIsAwesome() === true) {
    // This is us, manipulating the DOM
    var outputElement = document.getElementById('ouput');
    outputElement.innerHTML = 'Of course.';
  }
